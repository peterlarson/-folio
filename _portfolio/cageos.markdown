For my operating systems class sophmore year me and a team created an operating system. Ours was special because it was Nick Cage themed. 

To do this we renamed our shell> prompt cage>, and we included some ascii art. The startup screen is as follows: 
<div class="">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cageOS">
<img class="two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/cageos_splash.png" alt="" title="example image"/>
</a>
</div>

The operating system also had some more traditional features. A full version of it running in a javascript emulator can be seen <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cageOS"> here </a>.
