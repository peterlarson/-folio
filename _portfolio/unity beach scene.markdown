One project that I did was to make a simple unity game. I created models for the umbrella and the island in blender, and then exported them to unity. 

<div class="img_row">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/unity_beach_scene">
<img class="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/umbrella_beach_screen.PNG" alt="" title="example image"/>
</a>
</div>

A published version of the game is available <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/unity_beach_scene"> here </a>. This build was exported as a unity3d game rather than using webgl so it can not be viewed in Chrome or Edge.
