In the winter of my freshman year at rose-hulman me and some of my friends did a project for our object oriented programming class that we are still proud of. Our assignment was to recreate the arcade game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BurgerTime">burgertime</a>. 

The course was our introduction to Java, and so we completed the project using swing.

The feature we were most proud of in our implementation was a method of using a grid-based level and collision system, while having fluid motion for the player character and enemies. When our team was discussing how to represent the game we disagreed about weather we should use tiles. I was against it, but later we found that if we animated the character and enemies based on a location within a tile we could have smooth movement and use tiles for representing the level. This satisfied my concerns about the apperance of the game, while making conflicts, enemy routing, and loading/storing the game significantly easier.

The thing we were the most proud of was the final boss level. We deviated from the classic game and added a cyborg dog that shoots lasers. There was also an animated background and dramatic music
